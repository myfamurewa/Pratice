# Practice
A repository where I store my attempts at code challenges and examples of data structures that I'm trying to learn.

## Code Challenges

These code challenges come from Codewars, Leetcode, Edabit and HackerRank

## Data Structures

The data structures were created by following tutorials on youtube form free code camp. I created these files to gain a better understanding of how they work and what there best uses are.
