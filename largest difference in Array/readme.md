Good morning! Define a function largestDifference which takes an array of integers, and returns the largest positive difference from left to right.

For example, if [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9] is used as an argument with the function largestDifference, then the largest positive difference from left to right is 6 - the difference from 5 to 11.

To help visualize the problem, imagine you went on a hike and recorded your experience as a series of peak elevations. The elevations are recorded as the numbers in an array. The largestDifference function returns a value representing the greatest net gain in elevation from one spot to another.

Note that given an array of numbers which don't return a positive number, such as descent from one peak to another like [100, 90, 80, 50, 10], largestDifference would simply return 0.
